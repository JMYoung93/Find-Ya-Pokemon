# Find-Ya-Pokemon
A quick and easy application to look up your favorite pokemon. View an image of the classic trading card game from our past and view information about the pokemon of your choice. You also have the ability to build your own team of up to Six pokemon, each with 4 random moves and their own sprite image.
# User Story
AS A User I WANT to be able to search a pokemon by name SO THAT I can gather information about this pokemon
AS A User I WANT to be able to add this pokemon to a team SO THAT I can build the ultimate team and revisit a nostalgic part of my childhood.
AS A User I want to be able to see past search results SO THAT I can go back to recent searches I have made.
AS A User I want to store both my team and my search results on the page SO THAT when I refresh and come back to this page my information is stored
